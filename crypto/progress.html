<h1>
What Is A Cryptocurrency?</h1>
<br><br><p>
It is a technological advance so powerful that it transforms the very basic pillars of our society. A technology which fundamentally influences the way our economy, government systems and business's function.<br><br> It could change our conceptual understanding of trade ownership and trust. People often think of Cryptocurrencies as only virtual money or a transaction system. but if you look closer you will see the monetary aspect is just the tip of the iceberg. This is because it is a ground breaking Internet technology for which money is merely one of the possible applications.


<br><br><br><br><center>

<img src="http://smarter-way.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/colored-coins.png" width="70%">
<br><p>A selection of some of the most popular Cryptocurrencies icons.<br><br><br>

<p> Money exists to facilitate trade, for centuries trade had became incredibly complex as everybody is trading with each other worldwide. Trade is kept in book keeping and is often hidden from the public. For this reason we use third parties and middle men we trust to facilitate and approve our transactions. Governments, banks, notorieties and paper money are all trusted third parties. Cryptocurrencies eliminate this middle man giving the power back to the people using a peer to peer banking system. 
<br><br><br><br>
<div class="p4" width="100%"></div><br><br><br><br>

<h1>
The Essence Of Cryptocurrency</h1>
<br><br>
<p>

It enables a network of computers to maintain a collective book keeping via the Internet. This book keeping is not closed or in control of one party. It is public and available in one digital ledger which is distributed across the network, known as a Blockchain. Think of it is as P2P (peer to peer) banking.<br><br>In the Blockchain all transactions are logged including information on the time, date, participants and amount of every transaction.

<br><br>

Each Node (user) in the network contains a copy of the Blockchain on the basis of complicated state of the art mathematical principles. The transactions are verified by the Minors (people generating data) who maintain the ledger. The mathematical principles assure that these Nodes automatically and continuously agree the current state of the ledger and every transaction in it.<br><br> If anyone attempts to corrupt a transaction the Nodes will not arrive at a consensus and will refuse to incorporate the transactions in the Blockchain. Every transaction is public and thousands of Nodes unanimously agree that a transaction has occurred on a specific date and time. It is almost like there is a notary present at every transaction. <br><br> This way everyone has access to a single shared source of the truth. This is why we can always trust the Blockchain. The ledger dose not care whether a coin represents a certain amount of Euros or Dollars or anything else of value. users decide for themselves what a unit coin represents.

<br><br><br><br>


<div class="p6" width="100%"></div><br><br><br><br>

<h1>
The Future Of Money</h1>
<br><br><p>

1 coin is divisible by 100.000.000 units. Each unit is both individually identifiable and programmable. This means users can assign properties to each unit. Users can program a unit to represent a Euro cent, a share in a company, a killawatt of energy, a digital certificate of ownership.<br><br> Because of this crypto currencies are more then simply just money and payments. It can represent many kinds of property; a thousand barrels of oil, award credits or even a vote during an election.<br><br> Cryptocurrencies allow us to make our money smarter and to automise our cash and money flow. The programmable open character of this allows us to completely rebuild and innovate our financial sector and our administration processes making them more efficient and transparent aswell as significantly decreasing bureaucracy. <br><br>
In an internet of things are economy will be dealing with machines which actively participate in the economic traffic. A vending machine or a drone delivering packages are unfamiliar with the concept of trust, but cryptocurrencies are familiar. Because of cryptocurrencies a drone could be 100% certain that it will deliver the package to the right recipient and know for sure that has been paid for. A vending machine can be programmed in such a way it will automatically keep track of its supplies, ordering new supplies from the supplier and pay for them automatically. <br><br>This is only the beginning Internet technology is disruptive and breaks the status quo, it opens markets and breaks the positions of the middle men all the time.<br><br> Cryptocurrencies have caused a parodime shift its time to explore this new technology constructively and critically and openly discuss potential applications. Bankers and governments fear this technology because it takes away their power and gives it to the people.

<br><br><br><br>

<h1>
Bitcoin</h1>
<br><br>
<p>

Bitcoin is currently the "Transit Van" of cryptocurrencies in the sense that the name has became synonymous with the digital currency. It is the most used and best known out of the hundreds currently in existence. Invented by an unidentified programmer, or group of programmers, under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was introduced on 31 October 2008 to a cryptography mailing list, and released as open-source software in 2009. The earliest investors of Bitoin have multiplied their investments into thousands of percent.

<h1>
Occupy Movement</h1>
<br><br>
<p>

The Occupy movement is an international socio-political movement against social inequality and lack of "real democracy" around the world, its primary goal being to advance social and economic justice and new forms of democracy. The movement has many different scopes; local groups often have different focuses, but among the movement's prime concerns are how large corporations control the world in a way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy, and is unstable.
<br><br>
The first Occupy protest to receive widespread attention was Occupy Wall Street in New York City's Zuccotti Park, which began on 17 September 2011. By 9 October, Occupy protests had taken place or were ongoing in over 951 cities across 82 countries, and over 600 communities in the United States. Although most active in the United States, by October 2012 there had been Occupy protests and occupations in dozens of other countries across every continent except Antarctica. For its first month, overt police repression was minimal, but this began to change by 25 October 2011 when police first attempted to forcibly remove Occupy Oakland. By the end of 2011, authorities had cleared most of the major camps, with the last remaining high profile sites in Washington, D.C. and London evicted by February 2012.
<br><br>
The Occupy movement is partly inspired by the Arab Spring, 2009 Iranian Green Movement, and the Spanish Indignants movement in the Iberian Peninsula, the 2009 University of California occupations, as well as the overall global wave of anti-austerity protests. The movement commonly uses the slogan "We are the 99%", the #Occupy hashtag format, and organizes through websites such as Occupy Together. According to The Washington Post, the movement, which has been described as a "democratic awakening" by Cornel West, is difficult to distill to a few demands. On 12 October 2011, Los Angeles City Council became one of the first governmental bodies in the United States to adopt a resolution stating its informal support of the Occupy movement. In October 2012 the Executive Director of Financial Stability at the Bank of England stated the protesters were right to criticise and had persuaded bankers and politicians "to behave in a more moral way". <br><br>

<h1>
Anonymous</h1>
<br><br>
<p>

Anonymous is a loosely associated international network of activist and hacktivist entities. A website nominally associated with the group describes it as "an Internet gathering" with "a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives". The group became known for a series of well-publicized publicity stunts and distributed denial-of-service attacks on government, religious, and corporate websites.
<br><br>
Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan, representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an anarchic, digitized global brain. Anonymous members (known as "Anons") can be distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta.

<br><br><br><br>
<center>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/810477250353262596/2AjpZkRn.jpg" width="20%">  


<br><br><br><br>
<p>
In its early form, the concept was adopted by a decentralized online community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal, and primarily focused on entertainment, or "lulz". Beginning with 2008's Project Chanology—a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the Church of Scientology—the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions (including direct action) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S., Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; child pornography sites; copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. Anons have publicly supported WikiLeaks and the Occupy movement. Related groups LulzSec and Operation AntiSec carried out cyberattacks on U.S. government agencies, media, video game companies, military contractors, military personnel, and police officers, resulting in the attention of law enforcement to the groups' activities. Some actions by members of the group have been described as being anti-Zionist. It has threatened to cyber-attack Israel and engaged in the "#OpIsrael" cyber-attacks of Israeli websites on Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day) in 2013.
<br><br>
Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks, in countries including the U.S., UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, India and Turkey. Evaluations of the group's actions and effectiveness vary widely. Supporters have called the group "freedom fighters" and digital Robin Hoods while critics have described them as "a cyber lynch-mob" or "cyber terrorists". In 2012, Time called Anonymous one of the "100 most influential people" in the world.

<h1>
Peer 2 Peer</h1>
<br><br>
<p>

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.
<br><br>
Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided. Emerging collaborative P2P systems are going beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources, and are looking for diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a virtual community thereby empowering it to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, yet that are beneficial to all the peers.
<br><br>
While P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains, the architecture was popularized by the file sharing system Napster, originally released in 1999. The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. In such social contexts, peer-to-peer as a meme refers to the egalitarian social networking that has emerged throughout society, enabled by Internet technologies in general.

<h1>
Current Banking System</h1>
<br><br>
<p>

A bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest, transaction fees and financial advice. Traditionally, the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customers. The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities.
<br><br>
This difference is referred to as the spread between highly the cost of funds and the loan interest rate. Historically, profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle. Fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance.
<br><br>
In the past 20 years American banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions.

<h1>
Paper Currency Design</h1><p>
<br><br>
<p>
Currency is one of those ever-present objects in our lives, something that passes through our hands every day. So mundane that we don’t really notice what it looks like each time we see it.
<br><br>
But the design of our bills is ever-shifting, continuously updated for contemporary aesthetics. And when those changes happen, that’s when we take notice. A great example is last year, when Norway called for proposals to redesign their banknotes. They ended up with an abstracted coastal view of the country designed by Snøhetta Design, which has been touted by various design media as one of, if not the, best design circulating right now:




<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Norway-Krone.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br>
<p>

Currency design has also come up lately in popular culture as an issue in the U.S., with more and more people looking to see a woman or a person of color replacing the bills dominated by white men, mostly former presidents. The common suggestion is to replace Andrew Jackson on the $20, particularly considering the centennial of the women’s suffrage movement coming up in a few years.
<br><br>
All of this chatter drove us to look through some of the best designed currencies floating around — both those still in print, and those who have vanished into antiquity, and the hands of private collectors. Each country manages to find a way to imbue their currency with a sense of culture and history, each in their own fascinating way:


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Arubian-Florin.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

Aruban artist Evelino Fingal created this colorful line of banknotes in 1990, combining the country’s unique natural flora with the patterns of pre-Columbian pottery.



<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image_banknote.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

Australia was the first country to utilize a plastic polymer note, beginning in 1988 marking the country’s 200th anniversary. The designs featured famous cultural figures of the country, including Aboriginal writer David Unaipon as pictured above.




<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bermudian-Dollars.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>
Bermuda redesigned their currency to debut in 2009, as a celebration of their 400th anniversary — the first redesign since the launch of their dollar. The International Banknote Society awarded The Bermuda Monetary Authority for their work, specifically on the $2 note.


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bhutanese-Ngultrum.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

2006 is the latest in Bhutan’s series of notes, a bit younger currency than many others around today having started circulation in 1974. The image on the front of this bill is the government’s crest surrounded by dragons — a whimsically swirled aesthetic against the sharp lines of the background patterning.



<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Comorian-Franc.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

The first Comorian Paper money was printed in 1920, an emergency issue of Madagascar’s postage stamps fixed to a card that allowed them to be used as currency. The designs you still see today originated in the 1970s, with periodic tweaks to the design to add additional security measures.



<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://99designs-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image_banknote1.jpg?auto=format&q=60&fit=max&w=930" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

The Cook Islands pretty much dominate when it comes to natural imagery. How can you lose with a mermaid riding on top of a shark? This particular image comes from the 1987 banknote, the first series introduced and replaced shortly in 1992.


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dutch-Gulden.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>


While almost every note we see depicts the image of a country’s leader, historical figure, or a cultural or geographic signifier, it’s the differentiation in geometry, pattern, and color that really attracts our attention. That’s how it is with the Dutch Guilder, which on the reverse depicts this classic imagery, but on the obverse depicts a wonderfully symbolic abstraction of geometric shapes.



<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Fijian-Dollar.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

Couldn’t resist putting a denomination featuring a huge insect in our collection! The currently circulating set were designed in a series over a span of years, featuring all sorts of endemic flora and fauna. But our favorite is the Beli (Lever’s Goby), the winged flier decorating the $100 bill released in 2007.


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Hong-Kong-Dollar.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

Hong Kong Dollars are some of the most colorfully fun to get your hands on (fuchsia + cerulean? Yes please.) They do feature cultural and historical references, but in a layout geometrical and abstract enough to differentiate them from many other contemporary currencies.



<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Icelandic-Kronur.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

It’s hard to escape good design in Scandinavia, even on currency. In the traditional style, historical figures are featured and against the backdrop of folk patterns. But the whole image still manages to be laid out and colored in a way to feel like a very contemporary note.



<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Kazakhstan-Tenge.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

The current designs issued by the National Bank of Kazakhstan came around in 2006, with one side displaying vertically and the other horizontally as well as having text in both Kazakh and Russian. The obverse of each note depicts the same collection of cultural images in different colors, while the reverses focus on different sets of architecture and geography.


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Kuwaiti-Dinar.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

Currently on it’s sixth series debuting in 2014, the Kuwaiti Dinar feature collages of historical and contemporary cultural references, quite often including the traditional dhow boat.


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Maldivian-Rufiyaa.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>


The illustration for The Maldive’s currency were designed by Maizan Hassan Manik and Abbas. Paired with a palm tree, the boat is a Mas Odi, an old-style fishing vessel.

<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Mongolian-Tugrik.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

Mongolia’s design borrowed much of their color scheme and overall design from the Soviet Ruble during the days of the People’s Republic. The famed Ghengis Khan now stands on the high-denomination notes, including the 20,000 pictured above.


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nepalese-Rupee.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

In 2007 (and in a revised version in 2012), Nepal began to issue currency in which the traditional leader’s portrait was replaced by Mount Everest. This is a mirror of the political change from Kingdom to Republic, which happened in 2008.


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/New-Zealand-Dollar.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

1992 was the year that New Zealand’s latest design was rolled out, each depicting a famous New Zealander — with perhaps the most famous of all, Sir Edmund Hillary of Mt. Everest fame, on the $5 depicted above.


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sao-Tome-and-Principe-Dobra.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

As a centerpiece to the intricate design of native fauna and geometric patterns, the notes depict Rei Amador — King Amador: a historical leader said to have led a famous slave revolt on the islands in the 1500 and a symbol of freedom for the country.

<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Surinam-Gulden.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>

This last edition of Suriname’s Gulden were created in 2000 to reflect native flowers and birds. Despite the beauty of these notes, they were short-lived. The Surinamese Dollar replaced the Gulden in 2004.


<br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://blog.99cluster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Swiss-Franc.jpg" width="50%">
<br><br><br><br><p>


Switzerland is currently on their ninth series of banknotes, released in 2005. The designer, Manuela Pfrunder, was actually the second-prize winner of the competition held to design this newest round. Her design was selected, then largely modified for the final note, when the initial winner’s designs met with too much public resistance.

The normal world; we go to work in the city, all around us are enourmous knew buildings. They look alike but we will never be able to afford to live in them. Because they are not homes, they are blocks of money. Bought by global investors whos money has nowhere to go.
<br><br>
Brexit and Trump both happened, it showed that all the people who are supposed to tell you about the world, the journalists, politicians and think tank experts. They know nothing it shows that us and them live in a dream world detached from reality.
<br><br>
We spend our time on social media. The original vision for social media was that it was going to open up a new paradise where information was shared freely. 
<br><br>
Now the algorithms are so strong and know so much about us they only give us what they know we like. <br><br>
You have become trapped in an echo chamber, where all you see and hear is you.  You go into an office sit at a desk, but maybe it is a fake job, your real job is shopping. The true factories of our time are the shopping malls. That is where the real hard work is done. <br><br>
You are managed with performance targets and measured outcomes but as you sit in the glass walled offices you know the targets are manipulated and fake. Your managers know that you know. But you all sit there and pretend it is all objective and rational.
<br><br>
You are cool and you know what is cool. What it meant in the 1960’s is that you would pull back and see what the world really was. The violence and brutal power hidden under the surface, a detached gaze free from political manipulation. Then Politicians today have no idea what is happening. They pretend to be in control but they are helpless in the face of the refugee crisis.<br><br>
They do nothing to stop the corruption, the growing inequality, the emptying of the cities by the waves of money. Maybe they are not Politicians anymore, maybe their real job is to make us angry. When we are angry we click more. Clicks feed the ever-growing power and wealth of the corporations that run social media. <br><br>
We think we are expressing ourselves, really we are just components in their system. At the moment that system absorbs all opposition which is why nothing ever changes. <br><br>

40 Years ago there was another all encompassing system, it was in the Soviet Union. By the 70’s the system was beginning to crack. Russia had became a society where everyone knew what their leaders said was not real.
<br><br>

Because they could see with their own eyes that the economy was falling apart. But everyone had to play along and pretend that it was real, because no one could imagine any alternative. <br><br>

One soviet writer called it; Hypernomalisation, you were so much part of the system that it was impossible to see beyond it. The fakeness was hyper normal. <br><br>

We too are trapped in a system.<br>
We cannot see beyond it. <br>
But there is more out there.

Adam Curtis The Trap</h1><p>

<br><br><br><br><p>
The ultimate political goal at the hear of our age is the idea of individual freedom. In Britain our government has set out to create a revolution that will free individuals from control of the elites and bureaucracy's. A new world where we can chose our lives and not to be trapped by class or income into a presidenced role. The first step in our global revolution for democracy. 
If one steps back and looks at what has resulted, it is a very strange kind of freedom.

 <br><br> The attempt to liberate people from the dead hands of bureaucracy has lead to the rise of a new and increasingly controlling system of management, driven by targets and numbers. 
 <br><br>
 While governments committed to creating freedom of choice in all areas have actually presided over a rise of inequalities and dramatic collapse in social mobility. The consequence has been a return of the power of class and privilege.
 <br><br>Abroad the attempt to create democracy has lead not just to bloody mayhem but a rejection of the Americas lead campaign to bring freedom. It has summoned a anti democratic authoritarian Islamism. This in turn has helped inspire terrorist attacks in Britain itself.
 In response the government has dismantled long standing laws designed to protect our freedom.<br><br>
 In the 90's politicians from right and the left tried to extend an idea of freedom molded on the freedom of the market to all other areas of society. This was something that previously no one thought possible or appropriate but now has been seen as inevitable. <br><br>
 Because underlying it was a scientific model of ourselves, as simplified robots, rational calculations human beings, who's behavior and even feelings could be analysed and managed by numbers. What resulted was the very opposite of freedom.<br><br> The numbers took on a power of their own which began to create new forms of control greater inequalities and a return of a rigged class structure based on the power of money.<br><br> US & THEM<br><br> There is no them, there is only us. Banks want us to keep borrowing and spending. Fictitious irrational system. Banks and governments lie to us that they are for the people, however they are self seeking individuals who's needs could be best met through the market place. Not politics if unregulated the markets would benefit everyone. In the face of this simple irresistible argument politicians have given away much of their power. But has actually happened is the return of inequalities and social injustices which have been around for 100's of years. <br><br> We have allowed the elite to take over politics and inherently our money, driving self satisfaction and disregard of for-filling the publics needs. The governments and banks perceived us as computer like machines who's instincts had largely been coded within us millions of years before.<br><br> We live in a bourgeois society, this is the way we can over throw and take the power back to the people. <br><br> Since the end of the Cold War Liberal Democracy and Capitalism has spread across the planet. We need freedom without elites and tyrants. Like how the Oligarchs in Russia faced Economic Genocide. We need to create a Free-market Utopian. <br><br> Our government realizes on a simplistic economic model of human beings that allows inequality to grow and offers nothing possative in the face of the reactionary forces. They have helped to wake around the world.<br><br> If we ever want to escape from this limited world view we will have to rediscover the progressive positive ideas of freedom.
