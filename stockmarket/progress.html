<p class="p2">John Lewis<br><br></p><p>

Using augmented reality to display John Lewis furniture and products in your house. So before buying a couch from John Lewis you can see how it will look in your living room via augmented reality.<br><br>

<p class="p2">Nationwide<br></p><p>

Create a crypto currency and market it so the general public can use it not just for computer nerds. Inevitably the future of money is crypto currency so what better time the now to bring it to the mainstream.<br><br>

<p class="p2">BBC<br><br></p><p>

We could offer discounted tickets to people who want to experience the festival, however they need to wear Go-Pros at all times. The purpose of the go pro is so that other people can wear virtual reality headsets and experience the festival from the comfort of their living room, but still have a fully immersed experience of their favourite musicians. <br><br>

<p class="p2">The National Autism Society<br><br></p><p>

Create a short film or music video depicting a average looking young adult being misunderstood in a society, then at the end reveal they have autism.<br><br>


<p class="p2">Fur For Animals<br><br></p><p>

A bleak and in-depth emersion into fur production using a vertical reality headset guiding someone as if they are an animal being used for fur. They experience the conveyer belt through from the slaughter to the skinning in a first person point of view perspective.   <br><br>

Open Banking is an emerging term in financial services and financial technology that refers to, the use of Open APIs that enable third party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution.<br><br>

I plan to create a piece of data-driven content to engage an audience with a subject they might have previously ignored by financial services. Surprise, enlighten and educate my audience and make them think differently.<br><br>

Both finance and data can be intimidating and considered boring, so I have to change the story by capturing attention and keeping it. <br><br>

This app is for the general public, people open to being engaged and informed but who wouldnâ€™t normally give much thought to how data from a financial services provider can help them in some way.<br><br>

The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American film directed by Martin Scorsese which has became synounoumous with the stock & shares industry. The screenplay by Terence Winter is adapted from the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort and recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm Stratton Oakmont engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street that ultimately led to his downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio  stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his second wife Naomi Lapaglia and Kyle Chandler as Patrick Denham, the FBI agent who tries to bring him down.

Barclays</h1></h1>
<br><br>
<p>
Barclays is a British multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in London. It is a universal bank with operations in retail, wholesale and investment banking, as well as wealth management, mortgage lending and credit cards. It has operations in over 50 countries and territories and has around 48 million customers.<br><br>

Barclays is organized into four core business: Personal & Corporate (Personal Banking, Corporate Banking, Wealth & Investment Management), Barclaycard, Investment Banking and Africa.<br><br>

Barclays traces its origins to a goldsmith banking business established in the City of London in 1690. James Barclay became a partner in the business in 1736. In 1896 several banks in London and the English provinces, including Backhouse's Bank and Gurney's Bank, united as a joint-stock bank under the name Barclays and Co. Over the following decades Barclays expanded to become a nationwide bank. In 1967, Barclays deployed the world's first cash dispenser. Barclays has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including of London, Provincial and South Western Bank in 1918, British Linen Bank in 1919, Mercantile Credit in 1975, the Woolwich in 2000 and the North American operations of Lehman Brothers in 2008.<br><br>

Barclays has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
<br><br>
According to a 2011 paper by Vitali et al., Barclays was the most powerful transnational corporation in terms of ownership and thus corporate control over global financial stability and market competition with AXA and State Street Corporation taking the 2nd and 3rd position, respectively.<br><br>
