<i>Concepts</i><br><br>

<p class="p2">John Lewis<br><br></p><p>

Using augmented reality to display John Lewis furniture and products in your house. So before buying a couch from John Lewis you can see how it will look in your living room via augmented reality.<br><br>

<p class="p2">Nationwide<br></p><p>

Create a crypto currency and market it so the general public can use it not just for computer nerds. Inevitably the future of money is crypto currency so what better time the now to bring it to the mainstream.<br><br>

<p class="p2">BBC<br><br></p><p>

We could offer discounted tickets to people who want to experience the festival, however they need to wear Go-Pros at all times. The purpose of the go pro is so that other people can wear virtual reality headsets and experience the festival from the comfort of their living room, but still have a fully immersed experience of their favourite musicians. <br><br>

<p class="p2">The National Autism Society<br><br></p><p>

Create a short film or music video depicting a average looking young adult being misunderstood in a society, then at the end reveal they have autism.<br><br>


<p class="p2">Fur For Animals<br><br></p><p>

A bleak and in-depth emersion into fur production using a vertical reality headset guiding someone as if they are an animal being used for fur. They experience the conveyer belt through from the slaughter to the skinning in a first person point of view perspective.   <br><br>

Current working title<br><br><br><br><p >

Open Banking is an emerging term in financial services and financial technology that refers to, the use of Open APIs that enable third party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution.<br><br>

I plan to create a piece of data-driven content to engage an audience with a subject they might have previously ignored by financial services. Surprise, enlighten and educate my audience and make them think differently.<br><br>

Both finance and data can be intimidating and considered boring, so I have to change the story by capturing attention and keeping it. <br><br>

This app is for the general public, people open to being engaged and informed but who wouldn’t normally give much thought to how data from a financial services provider can help them in some way.<br><br>
